# Modules
----
Unlike Ruby, but like other programming languages such as Java or C, modules can be loaded to extend the functionality of the language. Some of the most commonly used modules include: —

- `strutils`
	- Additional functionality when dealing with strings
- `sequtils`
	- Additional functionality when dealing with sequences
- `math`
	- Mathematical functions (logarithms, square roots, …​), trigonometry (sin, cos, …​)
- `times`
	- Measure and deal with time

However, there are much more packages that can be found in either the standard library or the `nimble` package manager (basically like Ruby gems). 

## Loading a Module
Modules can be loaded quite easily by using the `import <module name>` statement.
